# Dotfiles

| Tools						         |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| [Neovim][]						 |
| Visual Studio Code with Vim keybindings                |
| [Alacritty][] or Gnome Terminal (Terminal emulator)    |
| [Manjaro Arch][] ([GNOME][] as desktop environment)    |

I use Neovim and Visual Studio Code depending on the language I'm working on. For languages, 
such as Java or Dart (with Flutter), I use Visual Studio Code for better language support.
